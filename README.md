# Contact Solution

ContactSolution is an app that I wanted to build to help keep track how long your current contact lenses are in use, as well as your contact case.

## Overview

### The Challenge

Currently, the application is still in development, but you will be able to:

- Separately track the days of each contact lens use. Sometimes I have to toss one contact, and keeping track of two different lenses was pitiful. 

- An alert will be sent when your contacts have been worn 30 days, and should be replaced.

- Track the number of days your current contact case has been in use.

- An alert will be sent when your contact case has been in use for 90 days and should be replaced.

- When starting with new lenses or a case, you can reset the counters for your left, and right contact. As well as for the contact case. 

- In addition to resetting the counter, you can subtract a day from the counter when you wear glasses, or add a day when you accidentally sleep in them :( .

- Soon, I would like to be able to begin tracking data, so each user can access the number of days contacts wore worn, glasses worn, etc.
