#contactSolution

ContactSolution is an app that helps you keep track of your eye contact usage. 

##What this Application does:

This app was to created to help keep track of your contact usage. 

You can separately track the days youâ€™ve worn both your left and right contacts. Too many times I've had to replace just one contact.

You can reset the counter at any time, subtract a day from the counter when you wear glasses, or add a day when you accidentally sleep in them.

This app will let you know when your contacts & contact case are due to be replaced. 

I highly recommend you never sleep with your contacts. 

Lastly, only for your eyes, this app will soon track the number of days of straight contact usage, number of days in glasses, and number of days slept in contacts.
